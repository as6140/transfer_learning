#Exploring Bias in Tweets by Members of Congress
Alex Shropshire and Mando Iwanaga

#Goal
Utilize transfer learning using ELMo, a deep contextualized word representation, to classify tweet text from politicians as having a democratic bias,a republican bias, or neutrality. 

#Results 
We however ran into some difficulties which resulted in us pivoting to a new methodology using a pre-trained model from BERT. Here is a link to our repo using BERT. https://github.com/as6140/political_bias_classifier_BERT


#Some Lessons Learned 
- Training a model requires extensive computational resources
